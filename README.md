# Linear regression and classification models on Delhi air and Pulsar data
This report aims to create linear regression model based on the New Delhi pollution
data and evaluate the performance of 3 classification models with the Pulsar dataset
using Python programming language. First part of the report focuses on predicting
the quantity of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) with linear regression, based on 8 different
pollution sources in New Delhi dataset. In second part of report, Na√Øve Bayes, Linear
Discriminant Analysis and Logistic Regression models were trained to classify
whether the neutron star is a pulsar and then compared between each other. The
analysis process for both parts included general inspection of the dataset, correlation
analysis, creating and training models, and general evaluation of the model based on
key metrics like R-squared and MRSE for linear regression and confusion matrices
and AUC scores for classifier models.
